* Time Complexity

The valid algorithm takes a finite amount of time for execution. The time required by the algorithm to solve given problem is called time complexity  of the algorithm. Time complexity is very useful measure in algorithm analysis.

Here considered time is not actual time, it is CPU operations f = N.
